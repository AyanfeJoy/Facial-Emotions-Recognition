# Facial-Emotions-Recognition
Developed a Facial Emotions Recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Deep Learning techniques to classify human emotions from facial expressions. I trained with 6 emotions.
FER is the technology that analyses facial expressions from both static images and videos in order to reveal information on oneâ€™s emotional state.
Recognition of emotion from facial expressions is crucial ro adaptive social behaviour. Emotion recognition guides response and action towards potential friendly or threatening others. As well, emotion recognition is paramount to successful communication between individuals.

Train Data: The model sees this data and adjusts its parameters to make predictions. There are 28273 images belonging to the 6 classes of emotions in the train dataset.

Testing Data: The model is tested on this unseen data to estimate its generalisation accuracy. There are 7067 images belonging to the 6 classes of emotions in the test dataset.


PROCESS
- Implemented data preprocessing techniques such as face detection, alignment, and normalization to prepare the dataset for training.

- Trained the model on a dataset of images labeled with six different emotions (Angry, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprise) to recognize and classify emotions.

- Utilized data augmentation techniques such as shear, zoom, and horizontal flip to increase the diversity of the training dataset.

- Created data generators using ImageDataGenerator to feed data into the model and enable efficient training and testing.

- Developed a Facial Emotions Recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Deep Learning techniques to classify human emotions from facial expressions.

- Deployed the model using OpenCV and Python to detect and recognize faces in real-time, achieving an accuracy of  73%.

- Successfully integrated the model with a webcam to detect and recognize facial emotions in real-time.

  I made a CNN model to predict the facial expression and solve real time problems and calculated the accuracy of the model which is 73.
Facial emotions and other gestures convey nonverbal communication cues that play an important role in interpersonal relations.
